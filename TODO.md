### In Progress
- [ ] Tests
  - [x] Workflow test with example data
  - [ ] Trivial examples for each function
  - [ ] Unit tests for SSI 
  - [ ] Unit tests for density features

### Plans
- [ ] More example tcl scripts for VMD 
- [ ] Feature comparison of more than two ensembles
  - [ ] with respect to the joint ensemble (all metrics)
  - [ ] with respect to a reference ensemble (will not always work for KLD)
- [ ] Use MDAnalysis instead of biotite for water featurization
- [ ] Weighted PCA/tICA? (to account for varying simulation lengths or uncertainty) 
- [ ] Make file format (png/pdf?) for matplotlib optional.

### Ideas

  - [ ] See if we can import or adapt [existing code](https://github.com/spiwokv/tltsne).
  - [ ] First tests with (regular) t-SNE
  - [ ] Test time-lagged t-SNE. How to handle time-dependence across simulations/ensembles?
  - [ ] write module
  - [ ] write unit tests
- [ ] Implement a clustering algorithem designed for structural ensembles
  - [ ] Read up about [CLoNe](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa742/5895303) 
  - [ ] First tests

  - [ ] write unit tests
- [ ] Contacts as features 
  - [ ] Think about a [GetContacts](https://getcontacts.github.io/) reader

  - [ ] Test implementations, e.g., [Xentropy](https://github.com/liedllab/X-Entropy) to find the best way to do it.
- [ ] Implement [multi-dimensional scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling)
- [ ] Try to integrate [functional mode analysis](http://www3.mpibpc.mpg.de/groups/de_groot/fma.html).
